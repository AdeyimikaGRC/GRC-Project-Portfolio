# RFK Hospital â€“ Vendor Risk Assessment (Simulated Project)

This project was developed as part of the RFK Specialist Hospital GRC simulation environment.  
The focus was on **vendor risk management**, particularly around selecting a payroll SaaS provider, after HR and Finance risks were noted in the hospitalâ€™s risk register.

## Background
- HR Risk: Delayed payroll processing due to software errors.  
- Finance Risk: Salary miscalculations due to system errors.  
- Risk Treatment Strategy: Outsource payroll to third-party providers.

To address this, we tested a **vendor due diligence process**, conducting side-by-side assessments of two potential vendors.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Risk Register Snippet**: The HR and Finance risks that led to this project.  
- **Questionnaires**: Completed vendor due diligence questionnaires (Vendor A & Vendor B).  
- **Risk Matrix**: Used to evaluate vendor responses and measure risk levels.  
- **Final Notes**: Decision rationale and assessment summary.

## Outcome
- Vendor A: Medium risk, conditional acceptance (required stronger controls).  
- Vendor B: Lower risk, public company with no breach history â†’ **Selected Vendor**.  
- Demonstrates how GRC practices (SoA, risk register, due diligence, and risk assessment) link together to close a risk
