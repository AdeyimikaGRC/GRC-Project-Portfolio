Project Context

This assessment was conducted to support RFK Specialist Hospital in mitigating payroll-related risks identified in the hospital’s risk register. After considering outsourcing as the treatment option, two potential payroll service providers (Payyab Solutions and ADS Ltd) were evaluated using a structured due diligence questionnaire and risk assessment framework.

Common Strengths Across Both Vendors

Both Payyab Solutions and ADS Ltd demonstrated strong baseline controls:

- Human Resource Security: Employees are required to sign NDAs, with background checks conducted.

- Access Management: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced, ensuring employees only access the data required for their role.

- Disciplinary Measures: Both vendors have documented disciplinary actions for employees involved in security breaches.

- Business Continuity: Both vendors maintain contingency plans for system failures, staffing shortages, or natural disasters.

- Audit Transparency: Both vendors agreed to provide prior audit reports upon request.

- These shared strengths establish a reasonable baseline for secure handling of RFK staff payroll data.

Distinctions Between Vendors

While both vendors met the baseline, ADS Ltd presented stronger assurances and risk controls compared to Payyab Solutions. Key distinctions include:

- Public Company: ADS Ltd is a publicly listed company, which increases accountability and transparency compared to Payyab Solutions(private).

- Breach History: ADS Ltd reported no security breaches within the past 3 years, unlike Payyab Solutions, which had weaker assurance in this area.

- Policy Availability: ADS Ltd maintains several publicly available policies (beyond privacy policy), while Payyab Solutions provided only a privacy policy and limited documentation.

- Physical Security: ADS Ltd operates onsite with robust controls—CCTV monitoring, physical security training, and visitor management. Payyab Solutions, being fully remote, lacks comparable physical security measures.
- Asset Inventory: ADS Ltd keeps a complete inventory list of all assets and constantly updated and reviewed, while Payyab Solutions do not have this. This is important so as to know when data are missing or have been stolen so it can be detected on time. 

Assessment Conclusion

The asses of the hospital in this case-study is the hospital’s staff payroll information,  and our priorities were higher assurance of security, accountability, and transparency, so with that, we realized:

- Payyab Solutions: Medium risk profile, conditional acceptance. Improvements required in asset inventory, disposal processes, and frequency of security testing.

- ADS Ltd: Lower risk profile, stronger governance and controls. Better suited for protecting sensitive payroll data.

Due to this, ADS Ltd was selected.
