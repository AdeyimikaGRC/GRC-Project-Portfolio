Project Context

This assessment was conducted to support RFK Specialist Hospital in mitigating payroll-related risks identified in the hospital’s risk register. After considering outsourcing as the treatment option, two potential payroll service providers (Vendor A and Vendor B) were evaluated using a structured due diligence questionnaire and risk assessment framework.

Common Strengths Across Both Vendors

Both Vendor A and Vendor B demonstrated strong baseline controls:

- Human Resource Security: Employees are required to sign NDAs, with background checks conducted.

- Access Management: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced, ensuring employees only access the data required for their role.

- Disciplinary Measures: Both vendors have documented disciplinary actions for employees involved in security breaches.

- Business Continuity: Both vendors maintain contingency plans for system failures, staffing shortages, or natural disasters.

- Audit Transparency: Both vendors agreed to provide prior audit reports upon request.

- These shared strengths establish a reasonable baseline for secure handling of RFK staff payroll data.

Distinctions Between Vendors

While both vendors met the baseline, Vendor B presented stronger assurances and risk controls compared to Vendor A. Key distinctions include:

Public Company: Vendor B is a publicly listed company, which increases accountability and transparency compared to Vendor A (private).

Breach History: Vendor B reported no security breaches within the past 3 years, unlike Vendor A, which had weaker assurance in this area.

Policy Availability: Vendor B maintains several publicly available policies (beyond privacy policy), while Vendor A provided only a privacy policy and limited documentation.

Physical Security: Vendor B operates onsite with robust controls—CCTV monitoring, physical security training, and visitor management. Vendor A, being fully remote, lacks comparable physical security measures.

Assessment Conclusion

Given the criticality of the hospital’s staff payroll information as an asset, higher assurance of security, accountability, and transparency was prioritized.

Vendor A: Medium risk profile, conditional acceptance. Improvements required in asset inventory, disposal processes, and frequency of security testing.

Vendor B: Lower risk profile, stronger governance and controls. Better suited for protecting sensitive payroll data.
